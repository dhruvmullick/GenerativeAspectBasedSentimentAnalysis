The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu.####The=O presentation=O of=O Snooze=T-NEG is=O excellent=O and=O it=O is=O one=O of=O those=O places=O that=O you=O feel=O more=O sophisticated=O just=O for=O being=O there;=O but=O peel=O back=O the=O layers=O and=O you=O have=O an=O overpriced=O IHOP=O with=O a=O high=O brow=O menu=T-NEG .=O

They serve it in a tall, skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket.####They=O serve=O it=O in=O a=O tall=O ,=O skinny=O hour-glass=O shaped=O glass=O to=O disguise=O the=O fact=O that=O you=O a=O getting=O a=O small=O juice=T-NEG at=O the=O price=O of=O a=O half=O gallon=O in=O a=O supermarket=O .=O

The pancakes were certainly inventive but $8.50 for 3 - 6" pancakes (one of them was more like 5") in the pancake flight (sample of 3 different pancakes) is well over-priced.####The=O pancakes=T-NEG were=O certainly=O inventive=O but=O $8.50=O for=O 3=O -=O 6"=O pancakes=O (one=O of=O them=O was=O more=O like=O 5")=O in=O the=O pancake=O flight=O (sample=O of=O 3=O different=O pancakes)=O is=O well=O over-priced=O .=O

On my meal I had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking, and would have had to send them back again if I hadn't rejected the meal all together.####On=O my=O meal=T-NEG I=O had=O to=O send=O back=O my=O eggs=T-NEG for=O a=O simple=O request=O of=O breaking=O the=O yokes=O before=O cooking=O ,=O and=O would=O have=O had=O to=O send=O them=O back=O again=O if=O I=O hadn't=O rejected=O the=O meal=O all=O together=O .=O
I rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and I was too frustrated to continue.####I=O rejected=O it=O because=O in=O the=O process=O of=O attempting=O to=O fix=O the=O eggs=O they=O broke=O something=O else=O in=O the=O dish=T-NEG and=O I=O was=O too=O frustrated=O to=O continue=O .=O

Ray's is something of a Seattle institution, but given its gorgeous Sound views, I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service.####Ray's=O is=O something=O of=O a=O Seattle=O institution=O ,=O but=O given=O its=O gorgeous=O Sound=T-POS views=T-POS ,=O I=O had=O suspected=O that=O the=O accolades=O were=O more=O due=O to=O the=O scenery=O than=O to=O the=O food=O and=O service=O .=O

My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.####My=O party=O of=O two=O was=O feeling=O particularly=O ambitious=O ,=O and=O we=O splurged=O on=O the=O Shilshole=T-POS Sampler...a=T-POS beautiful=O assortment=O of=O enormous=O white=T-POS gulf=T-POS prawns=T-POS ,=O smoked=O albacore=O tuna=O ,=O Ray's=O fantastic=O manila=T-POS clams=T-POS seasoned=O with=O dill=O ,=O scallops=O in=O a=O tasty=O soy=T-POS dressing=T-POS ,=O and=O a=O tiny=O pile=O of=O Dungeness=O crab=O atop=O a=O sublime=O butter=T-POS sauce=T-POS .=O

Our server continued to be attentive throughout the night, but I did remain puzzled by one issue:  Who thinks that Ray's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner?####Our=O server=T-POS continued=O to=O be=O attentive=O throughout=O the=O night=O ,=O but=O I=O did=O remain=O puzzled=O by=O one=O issue:=O Who=O thinks=O that=O Ray's=T-NEU is=O an=O appropriate=O place=O to=O take=O young=O children=O for=O dinner=O ?=O
